# Dont Copy Paste This Code, It Will Not Work And Instead Will Give You An Error

# If You Have Programmed Before, You Know What The Text 'Hello World' Is. If You Don't,
# Its Basically The First Program Anyone Writes When They Start Coding.
# The Program Says, 'Hello World!', So Lets Get Coding!

# To PRINT Text On The Screen, We Need To Call Our Printer! So We Type :
print
# Now This Isnt Exactly Right Since Our Printer Doesnt Know What To Print! So Do We Do This?
print Hello World!
# Hmmmm.... That Doesnt Seem To Work, Maybe It Doesnt Know THATS The Text To Print! We Need To Show it To Him In A Little Bundle!
print(Hello World!)
# What? That Doesn't Work Too? Ohhhh Yeah, Any text that's going to be printed has to be considered as a STRING! A STRING of text!
# To Make Text Into A String, We Need To Enclose It With :
# Single Quotes : ''
# Or Double Quotes : ""
# Okay Now Lets Put Our Knowledge Into This, So call out printer and make a bundle with a STRING of TEXT! This is How It Should Look Like :
print('Hello World!')
# Nice! You Learned How To Print Hello World!
# Now Dont Be Overwhelmed, I Just Talked About This Very Indepth, Nice Job!
