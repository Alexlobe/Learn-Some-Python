# Okay So Know That You Know How To Print Text, wait what? it doesnt work?
# Ah, I Forgot To tell you about : input() : Its A Very Important Part Of The Printing.
# It Checks For Input / Any Keys That You Press. Put it at the end of your print line then run the file. This is how it should look like :
print('Hello World!')
input()
# Now If You Open The File, It'll Stay There Until You Press A Key.
# Nice Job!
